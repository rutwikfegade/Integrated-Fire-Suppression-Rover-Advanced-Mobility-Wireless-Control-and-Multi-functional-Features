## AgniYantram the versatile rover
In this project, we aim to create a rover that can 
navigate its way into a burning structure and extinguish the 
fire. That will ensure that no human is exposed to the extreme 
heat and deadly smoke produced by such flames. However, fires 
can vary in terms of the accelerant and the origin of the fire, so 
we've installed three extinguishers on the rover to address this 
issue: a water-based extinguisher, a sound-based extinguisher, 
and a chemical-ball based extinguisher. We wanted to make 
sure the rover could move across trash, so we completed the 
design after several hours of research. The rover's six-wheel 
configuration allows it to accomplish the same. The IP camera 
positioned in the front for navigation is another crucial aspect 
of the design. The output from the camera displayed on our 
AgniYantram mobile app will allow the operator to view the 
live video and manage the rover. The mobile app linked to a 
cloud platform will store all the previous clips. A systematic log 
of all the past fires will ensure the fire department can rewatch 
videos and make notes with the videos. FAQs component will 
be included that will educate non-professional users. This 
project can be used not only by the fire service but also by non-profit organizations such as movie theatres and residential 
complexes.
